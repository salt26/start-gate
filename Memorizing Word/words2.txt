# [단어장 작성 방법]
# 단어장의 파일명은 항상 "words2.txt"이어야 하며, "StartGate.exe"와 같은 경로에 있어야 합니다.
# 단어장이 단어장으로 작동하려면 다음의 규칙에 따라 작성해야 합니다.
#
# #으로 시작하는 줄은 주석입니다. 이 줄의 내용은 "StartGate.exe"가 무시합니다.
# #으로 시작하지 않는 줄은 항상 다음과 같은 문법을 따라야 합니다.
#
#   Question:Answer1,Answer2,Answer3,Answer4
#
# 1. Question에는 ':'와 줄 바꿈 문자가 아닌 어떤 글자도 올 수 있습니다. 띄어쓰기나 한글, 한자, 일본어 등도 사용할 수 있습니다.
# 2. Question과 Answer 사이에는 항상 ':'이 놓여야 합니다.
# 3. ':' 뒤에는 Answer가 1개 이상 4개 이하로 올 수 있습니다. 5개 이상의 Answer를 적으면 안 됩니다.
# 4. Answer에는 ','과 ':'와 줄 바꿈 문자가 아닌 어떤 글자도 올 수 있습니다. 물론 띄어쓰기 등도 사용할 수 있습니다.
# 5. 서로 다른 Answer는 ','로 구분합니다. ',' 앞뒤에 공백이 붙지 않게 신경쓰면 좋습니다.
# 6. # 없이 빈 줄이 오면 안 됩니다. 특히 문서의 맨 끝에 줄 바꿈이 입력되지 않도록 해주세요.
#
# [작동 원리]
# Memorizing Word 폴더의 "StartGate.exe"를 실행하면 같은 경로에 있는 "words2.txt"에서 단어를 읽어 무작위 순서로 20문제를 냅니다.
# 문제에는 Question만 주어지며, 사용자는 Answer 중 하나의 답을 똑같이 입력해야 합니다.
# 답을 입력할 때 띄어쓰기는 아무 영향을 주지 않지만, 나머지 글자는 정확하게 입력해야 맞은 것으로 처리됩니다.
# 단어장에 Answer를 여러 개 적는 경우 이들을 복수정답으로 인정하겠다는 의미입니다.
